## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![image1](
In this analysis we are able to make the conclusion that the vehicle length and the ground clearence have a statistical significant influence on the miles per gallon. This is because they have a p-value of less than .05. This means they can be considered statistically significant and can be used to reject the null hypothesis. Alternativly, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD have p-values greater than .05 so they are not able to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence interval. Thus, they are not able to be proven to be statistically significant towards the mpg. 
The p-value for this model is 5.35e-11. This is smaller than the assumed significance level which is .05%. This means that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis which in turn means the slope of the line is not 0.
This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71.5% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Essentially, his multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
